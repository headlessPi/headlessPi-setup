# headlessPi-setup
An Ansible playbook to set up the Raspberry Pi as a headless Pi.

# Getting Started
Clone this repository somewhere. Run the bootstrap.sh script on the Pi. You can do this remotely by running:

```
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local "sudo bash -s" < ./bootstrap.sh
```

Or you can copy it to the Pi and run it from there.
